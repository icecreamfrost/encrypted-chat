# encrypted-chat(WIP!!!)
so basically this is a python code where you can talk to other person by entering the ipv4 address of you and the other person, this is a work in progress i have not yet added any encryption

ok so secue.py was my first code to make this encrypted messager however i did some mistakes , so i corrected it. Morever i added some optimised my code using  co-pilot  so that it will run more smoothly, I used ai because we must know how to adapt the use of  ai in our projects. We shouldnt be completely dependent on them , beacause at the end of the day you learned nothing and let the machine do hard work.

That beign said the next step of this plan is to add encryption , I am  working on that and the final version will be ready and published within a week.
ADIOS!
